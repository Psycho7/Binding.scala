**Binding.scala** is a data-binding framework for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), running on both JVM and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

Binding.scala can be used as a **[reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) web framework**.
It enables you use native XHTML literal syntax to create reactive DOM nodes,
which are able to automatically change whenever the data source changes.

See [Binding.scala â€¢ TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/binding-scala/) or [other live DEMOs](https://thoughtworksinc.github.io/Binding.scala/) as examples for common tasks when working with Binding.scala.

## Comparison to other reactive web frameworks

Binding.scala has more features and less concepts than other reactive web frameworks like [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

See [Design](#design) section for more information.

## Getting started

We will build an Binding.scala web page during the following steps.

### Step 0: Setup a Sbt Scala.js project

See http://www.scala-js.org/tutorial/basic/ for information about how to setup such a project.

### Step 1: Add Binding.scala dependencies into your `build.sbt`:

``` scala
libraryDependencies += "com.thoughtworks.binding" %%% "dom" % "latest.release"

addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.1.0" cross CrossVersion.full)
```

### Step 2: Create a `data` field, which contains some `Var` and `Vars` as data source for your data-binding expressions

``` scala
case class Contact(name: Var[String], email: Var[String])

val data = Vars.empty[Contact]
```

A `Var` represents a bindable variable,
which also implements `Binding` trait,
hence a `Var` can be seen as a binding expression as well.
If another expression depends on a `Var`, the value of the expression changes whenever value of the `Var` changes.

A `Vars` represents a sequence of bindable variables,
which also implements `BindingSeq` trait,
hence a `Vars` can be seen as a binding expression of a sequence as well.
If another comprehension expression depends on a `Vars`,
the value of the expression changes whenever value of the `Vars` changes.

### Step 3: Create a `@dom` method that contains data-binding expressions

``` scala
@dom
def table: Binding[Table] = {
  <table border="1" cellPadding="5">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>E-mail</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {
        for (contact <- data) yield {
          <tr>
            <td>
              {contact.name.bind}
            </td>
            <td>
              {contact.email.bind}
            </td>
          </tr>
        }
      }
    </tbody>
  </table>
}
```

A `@dom` method represents a data-binding expression.

The return type is always wrapped in a `com.thoughtworks.binding.Binding` trait.
For example `@dom def x: Binding[Int] = 1`,  `@dom def message: Binding[String] = "content"`

A `@dom` method supports HTML literal.
Unlike normal XML literal in a normal Scala method,
the types of HTML literal are specific subtypes of `org.scalajs.dom.raw.Node` or `com.thoughtworks.binding.BindingSeq[org.scalajs.dom.raw.Node]`,
instead of `scala.xml.Node` or `scala.xml.NodeSeq`.
So we could have `@dom def node: Binding[org.scalajs.dom.raw.HTMLBRElement] = <br/>`
and `@dom def node: Binding[BindingSeq[org.scalajs.dom.raw.HTMLBRElement]] = <br/><br/>`.

A `@dom` method is composed with other data-binding expressions in two ways:

 1. You could use `bind` method in a `@dom` method to get value of another `Binding`.
 2. You could use `for` / `yield` expression in a `@dom` method to map a `BindingSeq` to another.

You can nest `Node` or `BindingSeq[Node]` in other HTML element literals via `{ ... }` interpolation syntax.

### Step 4: render the data-binding expressions to DOM in the `main` method

``` scala
@JSExport
def main(): Unit = {
  dom.render(document.body, table)
}
```

### Step 5: Invoke the `main` method in a HTML page

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js-fastopt.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      SampleMain().main()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you will see a table that just contains a header, because `data` is empty at the moment.

### Step 6: Add some `<button>` to fill `data` for the table

``` scala
@dom
def table: Binding[BindingSeq[Node]] = {
  <div>
    <button
      onclick={ event: Event =>
        data.get += Contact(Var("Yang Bo"), Var("yang.bo@rea-group.com"))
      }
    >
      Add a contact
    </button>
  </div>
  <table border="1" cellPadding="5">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>E-mail</th>
        <th>Operation</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {
        for (contact <- data) yield {
          <tr>
            <td>
              {contact.name.bind}
            </td>
            <td>
              {contact.email.bind}
            </td>
            <td>
              <button
                onclick={ event: Event =>
                  contact.name := "Modified Name"
                }
              >
                Modify the name
              </button>
            </td>
          </tr>
        }
      }
    </tbody>
  </table>
}
```

When you click the "Add a contact" button, it appends a new Contact into `data`,
then, Binding.scala knows the relationship between DOM and `data`,
so it decides to append a new `<tr>` corresponding to the newly appended Contact.

And when you click the "Modify the name", the `name` field on `contact` changes,
then, Binding.scala decides to change the content of the corresponding `tr` to new value of `name` field.

See https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala-sample for the complete example.


## Design

### Precise data-binding

ReactJS requires users provide a `render` function for each component.
The `render` function should map `props` and `state` to a ReactJS's virtual DOM,
then ReactJS framework creates a DOM with the same structure as the virtual DOM.

When `state` changes, ReactJS framework invokes `render` function to get a new virtual DOM.
Unfortunately, ReactJS framework does not precisely know what the `state` changing is.
ReactJS framework has to compare the new virtual DOM and the original virtual DOM,
and guesses the changeset between the two virtual DOM,
then apply the guessed changeset to the real DOM as well.

For example, after you prepended a table row, say, `<tr>`, into an existing `<tbody>` in a `<table>`,
ReactJS may think you changed the content of the every existing `<tr>`s of the `<tbody>`,
and appended another `<tr>` at the tail of the `<tbody>`.

The reason is that the `render` function for ReactJS does not describe the relationship between `state` and DOM.
Instead, it describes the process to create a virtual DOM.
As a result, the `render` function does not provide any information about the purpose of the `state` changing,
although a data-binding framework should need the information.

Unlike ReactJS, a Binding.scala `@dom` method is NOT a regular function.
It is a template that describes the relationship between data source and the DOM.
When partial of the data source changed, the Binding.scala framework understands the exact partial DOM corresponding to the partial data.
Then, Binding.scala only re-evaluates partial of the `@dom` method to update the partial DOM.

With the help of the ability of precise data-binding provided by Binding.scala,
you can get rid of concepts for hinting ReactJS's guessing algorithm,
like `key` attribute, `shouldComponentUpdate` method, `componentDidUpdate` method or `componentWillUpdate` method.

### Composability

The smallest composable unit in ReactJS is a component.
It is fair to say that a React component is lighter than an AngularJS controller,
while Binding.scala is better than that.

The smallest composable unit in Binding.scala is a `@dom` method.
Every `@dom` method is able to compose other `@dom` methods via `.bind`.

``` scala
case class Contact(name: Var[String], email: Var[String])

@dom
def bindingButton(contact: Contact): Binding[Button] = {
  <button
    onclick={ event: Event =>
      contact.name := "Modified Name"
    }
  >
   Modify the name
  </button>
}

@dom
def bindingTr(contact: Contact): Binding[TableRow] = {
  <tr>
    <td>{ contact.name.bind }</td>
    <td>{ contact.email.bind }</td>
    <td>{ bindingButton(contact).bind }</td>
  </tr>
}

@dom
def bindingTable(contacts: BindingSeq[Contact]): Binding[Table] = {
  <table>
    <tbody>
      {
        for (contact <- contacts) yield {
          bindingTr(contact).bind
        }
      }
    </tbody>
  </table>
}

@JSExport
def main(): Unit = {
  val data = Vars(Contact(Var("Yang Bo"), Var("yang.bo@rea-group.com")))
  dom.render(document.body, bindingTable(data))
}
```

You may find out this approach is much simpler than ReactJS, as:

 * Instead of passing `props` in ReactJS, you just simply provide parameters for  Binding.scala.
 * Instead of specifying `propTypes` in ReactJS, you just simply define the types of parameters in Binding.scala.
 * Instead of raising a run-time error when types of props do not match in ReactJS, you just check the types at compile-time.

### Lifecycle management for data-binding expressions

The ability of precise data-binding in Binding.scala requires listener registrations on the data source.
Other reactive frameworks that have the ability ask users manage the lifecycle of data-binding expressions.

For example, [MetaRx](https://github.com/MetaStack-pl/MetaRx/issues/45) provides a `dispose` method to unregister the listeners created when building data-binding expressions.
The users of MetaRx have the responsibility to call `dispose` method for every `map` and `flatMap` call after the expression changes,
otherwise MetaRx leaks memory. Unfortunately, manually `dispose`ing everything is too hard to be right for complicated binding expressions.

Another reactive web framework [Widok](https://github.com/widok/widok/issues/29) did not provide any mechanism to manage lifecycle of of data-binding expressions.
As a result, it simply always leaks memory.

In Binding.scala, unlike MetaRx or Widok, all data-binding expressions are pure functional, with no side-effects.
Binding.scala does not register any listeners when users create individual expressions,
thus users do not need to manually unregister listeners for a single expression like MetaRx.

Instead, Binding.scala create all internal listeners together,
when the user calls `dom.render` or `Binding.watch` on the root expression.
Note that `dom.render` or `Binding.watch` manages listeners on all upstream expressions,
not only the direct listeners of the root expression.

In brief, Binding.scala separates functionality in two kinds:
 * User-defined `@dom` methods, which produce pure functional expressions with no side-effects.
 * Calls to `dom.render` or `Binding.watch`, which manage all side-effects automatically.

### HTML literal and statically type checking

As you see, you can embed HTML literals in `@dom` methods in Scala source files.
You can also embed Scala expressions in braces in content or attribute values of the HTML literal.

``` scala
@dom
def notificationBox(message: String): Binding[Div] = {
  <div class="notification" title={ s"Tooltip: $message" }>
    {
      message
    }
  </div>
}
```

Regardless the similar syntax of HTML literal between Binding.scala and ReactJS,
Binding.scala create real DOM instead of ReactJS's virtual DOM.

In the above example, `<div>...</div>` create a DOM element with the type of `org.scalajs.dom.html.Div`.
Then, the magic `@dom` let the method wrap the result as a `Binding`.

You can even assign the `Div` to a local variable and invoke native DOM method on the variable:

``` scala
@dom
def notificationBox(message: String): Binding[Div] = {
  val result: Div = <div class="notification" title={ s"Tooltip: $message" }>
    {
      message
    }
  </div>

  result.scrollIntoView()

  result
}
```

`scrollIntoView` method will be invoked when the `Div` is created.
If you invoked another method that does not defined in `Div`,
the Scala compiler will report an compile-time error instead of bringing the failure to run-time,
because Scala is a statically typed language and the Scala compiler understand the type of `Div`.

You may also notice `class` and `title`. They are DOM properties or HTML attributes on `Div`.
They are type-checked by Scala compiler as well.

For example, given the following `typo` method:

``` scala
@dom
def typo = {
  val myDiv = <div typoProperty="xx">content</div>
  myDiv.typoMethod()
  myDiv
}
```

The Scala compiler will report errors like this:

```
typo.scala:23: value typoProperty is not a member of org.scalajs.dom.html.Div
        val myDiv = <div typoProperty="xx">content</div>
                     ^
typo.scala:24: value typoMethod is not a member of org.scalajs.dom.html.Div
        myDiv.typoMethod()
              ^
```

With the help of static type system, `@dom` methods can be much robuster than ReactJS components.

You can find a complete list of supported properties and methods on [scaladoc of scalajs-dom](http://www.scala-js.org/api/scalajs-dom/0.8/org/scalajs/dom/raw/HTMLElement.html) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)

#### Custom attributes

If you want to suppress the static type checking of attributes, add a `data:` prefix to the attribute:

``` scala
@dom def myCustomDiv = {
  val myDiv = <div data:customAttributeName="attributeValue"></div>
  assert(myDiv.getAttribute("customAttributeName") == "attributeValue")
  myDiv
}
```

The Scala compiler will not report errors now.
